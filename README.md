Figures from the manuscript were generated using:
- Fig_2_Parametric_models.r
- Fig_3_Forest_plot.r
- Fig_4_CDF_combined.r
- Fig_5_A_subgroup_viability_GM.r
- Fig_5_B_subgroup_viability_AM.r
- Fig_6_A_ratio_temperature.r
- Fig_6_B_temperature_distribution.r
- Fig_7_subgroup_sampling_GM.r

For model selection, the marginal deviance information criterion (mDIC) has been calculated with:
- Sup_Mat_mDIC_PGA.r
- Sup_Mat_mDIC_PLN_LeCo.r

The database is included in the file: Database-qPCR_cultivation.xlsx
